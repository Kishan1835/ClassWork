# React + Create React App

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working with Create React App.

## Getting Started

To create a new React app using Create React App, follow these steps:

1. **Install Create React App**: If you haven't already, you can create a new React app using npx:

   ```bash
   npx create-react-app my-react-app
   ```

2. **Navigate to your project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd my-react-app
   ```

3. **Run the development server**:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Build for production**:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. **Test the production build**:
   You can serve the production build using a static server. First, install a static server:
   ```bash
   npm install -g serve
   ```
   Then, run:
   ```bash
   serve -s build
   ```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm start` - Starts the development server.
- `npm run build` - Builds the app for production.
- `npm test` - Launches the test runner.
- `npm run eject` - Ejects the configuration (use with caution).

This setup provides a solid foundation for building React applications.
